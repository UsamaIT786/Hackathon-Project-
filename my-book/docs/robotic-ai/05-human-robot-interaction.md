# Human-Robot Interaction

## Overview

Modern robots work alongside humans. Safe, natural interaction is critical. This chapter covers the technologies and approaches that enable effective human-robot teams.

## Safety Requirements

**Force Limits**: Robots must operate within safe force thresholds
**Speed Limits**: Reduce speed near humans
**Emergency Stop**: Immediate halt capability
**Tactile Feedback**: Detect unintended contact

## Communication Modalities

**Verbal**: Natural language understanding and generation
**Visual**: Gestures, expressions, lights
**Haptic**: Force feedback for collaboration
**Implicit**: Predict human intent

## Collaborative Tasks

**Handling-over**: Robot gives object to person
**Assembly**: Human and robot assemble together
**Teaching**: Human shows robot new tasks
**Inspection**: Robot and human examine together

## Legal and Ethical

- **Responsibility**: Who's liable if robot causes injury?
- **Privacy**: What can robot observe?
- **Consent**: Is operator aware and willing?
- **Fairness**: Does automation displace workers?

## Summary

Human-robot interaction is becoming critical as robots move into human spaces. Safety, communication, and ethical considerations are paramount.
