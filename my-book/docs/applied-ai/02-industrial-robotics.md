# Case Study: Industrial Robotics

## Overview

Manufacturing is where robotics matured. Factory robots represent proven technology at scale. This chapter examines how industrial robotics works and impacts manufacturing.

## Robot Types in Factories

**Assembly Robots** (articulated arms)
- Precise positioning
- Fast repetitive tasks
- High uptime required

**AGVs** (Autonomous Guided Vehicles)
- Transport materials
- Navigate factory floor
- Coordinate with workers

**Vision-Guided Robots**
- Locate parts
- Inspect quality
- Adapt to variation

## Factory Workflow

```
Raw materials arrive
    ↓
Robots transport to workstations
    ↓
Assembly robots pick/place/weld
    ↓
Vision systems inspect
    ↓
Defects flagged, good parts continue
    ↓
Packaging robots prepare for shipping
```

## Benefits

**Productivity**: Faster than humans, no breaks
**Consistency**: Identical quality every time
**Safety**: Remove humans from dangerous tasks
**Cost**: Over years, ROI is positive

## Challenges

**Flexibility**: Traditional robots do one task (hard to reprogram)
**Dexterity**: Can't match human hand skill
**Unforeseen situations**: Limited adaptation
**Human coordination**: Working safely alongside humans

## Modern Evolution

**Collaborative robots (cobots)**:
- Designed to work with humans
- Force-limited for safety
- Easier to program
- More flexible than traditional industrial robots

**AI-Powered robotics**:
- Vision-guided picking
- Learning from demonstration
- Adaptive to variations
- Reduced programming time

## Economic Impact

Assembly line (1913): Ford's innovation enabled mass production
Robots (1960s-1980s): Automation of repetitive tasks
AI-Enabled robots (2020s): Automation of complex, variable tasks

**Current trend**: Smaller companies adopting robotics
- Cheaper robots
- Easier to program
- Better ROI

## Summary

Industrial robotics demonstrates that robots work at scale. The frontier is extending automation to more tasks—especially those requiring perception and adaptation.
