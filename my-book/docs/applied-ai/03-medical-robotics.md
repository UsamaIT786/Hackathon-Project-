# Case Study: Medical Robotics

## Overview

Medicine demands precision and reliability. Surgical robots amplify surgeon skill and enable new procedures. This chapter covers medical robotics applications and challenges.

## Surgical Robotics

**da Vinci Surgical System** (most common)
- Master-slave configuration
- Surgeon controls remotely
- Robotic arms perform surgery
- Minimal invasive procedures

**Advantages:**
- Smaller incisions (faster recovery)
- Better dexterity (tremor filtering)
- Better visualization (magnified view)
- Reproducible motions

**Limitations:**
- Expensive ($1-3M)
- Requires surgeon training
- Limited to certain procedures
- No true autonomy (surgeon drives)

## Rehabilitation Robots

**Exoskeletons**: Help patients regain mobility
- Paralyzed patients walk again
- Physical therapy assistance
- Repetitive motion training

**Benefits**: Recover faster, practice more, safety assured

## Perception Requirements

Medical robots must:
- Localize anatomy precisely
- Recognize pathology
- Track instrument position
- Adapt to patient variation

**Technologies:**
- CT/MRI integration
- Real-time ultrasound
- Optical tracking
- Augmented reality overlay

## Safety and Regulation

**FDA Approval**: Rigorous testing required
**Error Modes**: What if system fails mid-surgery?
**Sterilization**: How to keep robot clean?
**Liability**: Responsible if wrong outcome?

**Current approach**: Supervised autonomy
- Robot assists surgeon
- Surgeon maintains control
- Safety interlock prevents dangerous motions

## Future Directions

**Autonomous Surgery**: Robot performs procedure entirely
- Requires much higher reliability
- Regulatory hurdles significant
- Remote surgery (surgeon in different location)
- Telemedicine enabled

## Summary

Medical robotics shows why Physical AI matters: amplifies human capability and enables impossible procedures. Safety and reliability are paramount.
